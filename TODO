# TODO for Brick

## In Progress

## Not Started

* Implement sprite creation function
* Implement gui label creation function
* Implement brick generation code
* Create logic for setting up game level
* Figure out some way to more easily set relative position of sprites
    (for screen-size changes during gameplay)
* Implement logic to send bricks down the play field
* Add collision detection for bricks
    (each brick object should probably have collision points as data)
