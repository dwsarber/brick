# TODO for Brick

## In Progress

* (DYLAN) Add collision detection for bricks
    (each brick object should probably have collision points as data)
* (DYLAN) Implement logic to send bricks down the play field

## Not Started

* Implement brick generation code
* Figure out some way to more easily set relative position of sprites
    (for screen-size changes during gameplay)
* Implement a way to set collision points for the bricks and other sprites


## Done

* Implement gui label creation function
